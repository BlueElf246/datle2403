 pre-trained model is a network that's already been trained on a large dataset and saved,
 which allows you to use it to customize your own model cheaply and efficiently.
 The one you'll be using, MobileNetV2, was designed to provide fast and computationally efficient performance.
  It's been pre-trained on ImageNet, a dataset containing over 14 million images and 1000 classes.
